## Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?
This study aims to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
## About The Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers whopurchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
## Business Task
### How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
The findings from this study will assist the business in developing a data-driven marketing strategy grounded in historical trip data, highlighting the distinctions between casual users and annual members. During this phase, I will also engage key stakeholders to gather insights into their previous marketing strategies.

## Result
Based on my analysis, I have several conclusions. Casual riders spend an average of 44 minutes riding their bikes, which is surprising because the number of casual riders is less than annual members but has an average time riding a bike that is greater than annual members, where annual members only spend an average of about 16 minutes. Based on daily rider trends, annual members use their bikes more to work because the volume of annual member riders is highest at 6:00 to 8:00 and 15:00 to 18:00, while the volume of casual riders is highest in the afternoon to evening around 13:00 to 18:00. Both annual members and casual riders ride their bikes more during the weekend than on weekdays, but there is a significant difference in the duration of casual riders which is longer than annual members. The type of bike most used by both annual members and casual riders is a parked bike, the rest use electric bikes and only a few use classic bikes. In early spring, the volume of cyclists, both annual members and casual riders, began to increase precisely in February, but dropped again in mid-March because at that time the government announced that it would implement a lockdown to reduce the spread of Covid-19. After the rules were relaxed, the volume of cyclists began to increase again, peaking during the summer holidays.

To answer the question in the case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?, I have 3 recommendations to increase the number of annual members and convert casual riders into annual members.

1. Create promotions and bonuses for annual member riders who travel long distances or long times, so that they attract a lot of attention for casual riders to start annual subscriptions.
2. Spread annual membership promotion advertisements at stations that are crowded with cyclists, and offer a trial program to casual riders.
3. Create discount offers for cyclists who want to subscribe during the summer holidays, because there is a spike in rider volume during the summer holidays.

There are several other factors to help successful marketing such as the use of social media, educating the public about the benefits of cycling, and efforts to make the city free from vehicle exhaust pollution.
